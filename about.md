Please do not use anything from my blog without asking.

Please think on your own and if you need advice get in touch with a
professional. I'm not a professional and nothing that you find in my blog can
be taken as advice from a professional.

We are surrounded by stimuli that change us. Some changes are tiny while others
are huge. This can result in inaccurate, misleading, biased, erroneous or in
other ways problematic content. Please give me a note if you see something that
seems to be odd in my blog.
